# Atomik

Atomik provides you a python-friendly way to manage writing new file and folders in an atomic way.
The main way to use the library is with to use the `file` and `folder` context manager. They will provide
an easy interface to make sure **the destination file/folder** is either fully 


## Example
### File
This will ensure either all the data is correctly written to file or none of it
```
with atomik.file("./result.json") as f:
    print(stream, file=f)
```

### Folder
```
with atomik.folder("./result_folder") as dir:
    with open(Path(dir, "result_1.json") as f:
        print(result_1, file=f)
    with open(Path(dir, "result_2.json") as f:
        print(result_2, file=f)
```

## Safe default

By default, atomik will not overwrite files/non-empty folders, but it's configurable. 

## How ?

Atomik uses the new `renameat2` syscall to allow to rename file in an atomic way. While 

## Limitation

The syscall doesn't allow to overwrite a non-empty folder when renaming. 
This is achieved using the `exchange` flag to swap the two folder and then the source
folder is cleaned. This may leave the `src` folder in case of interruption/issue when deleting
but the destination folder will still be written in an atomic way.
